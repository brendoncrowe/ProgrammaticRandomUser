# ProgrammaticRandomUser
This app was developed 100% in code. The goal was to focus on building the core features of a simple collection view app.
- The app uses a random users api, and passes the date into the custom collection view cells
- The image and name are then passed to a detail controller 
- **Xibs and storyboards were not allowed to be used**
